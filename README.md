### Topic: The Effect of Education on Poverty

### Abstract:
<p>The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of high school education (grades IX-XII)
on poverty. The Gross Enrolment Ratio for Classes IX-XII is the education variable. The
poverty Rate during 2011-12 is the dependent variable. Other independent variables used
include labor force participation rate, literacy rate, unemployment rate, percentage of the
population living in urban areas and per capita net state domestic product. We gathered data
for this study from 2011 to 2012.<br>
To begin, we created a simple regression model with only a primary independent variable and
a dependent variable to estimate the impact of education on poverty in the absence of other
variables. Then we created a multiple regression model that included all other explanatory
variables and discussed their effects and significance. Then we created model 3 by removing
statistically insignificant variables from model 2. We used F-statistics and t-statistics to
determine whether or not the variables were statistically significant.<br>
We discovered a significant negative relationship between gross enrolment ratio i.e.
education variable and poverty through this research.
